## Introductions
- Welcome to the data-driven modeling in science and engineering course! 
- This is the first lecture, and I'm going to introduce myself and the course.
- My name is Joseph Bakarji and I'm a new professor at AUB, at the department of mechanical engineering, and the AI Hub. 

- This course is titled Data-driven modeling in science and engineering
- In this first lecture I will tell you a little about the course, logistics 

- I graduated from the department of mechanical engineering at AUB in 2013, did a long journey along the west coast in the the US, and came back to AUB 10 years later.
- I've done research in a wide range of topics including fluid dynamics, mechatronics, material science, artificial intelligence, social dynamics; but my main research interests are:
    - Understanding how the world works, using both brains and machines 
    - Understanding how intelligence works, both in brains and machines. That is, understanding understanding.

This course reflects those interests. It's a senior undergraduate and graduate course. It assumes that you have some knowledge of linear algebra, differential equations, numerical methods, and programming. But don't worry if you don't, we'll cover all of those in the course.

### What is the course about?
If you're taking this course, you've probably heard of artificial intelligence, and maybe also machine learning. And you've heard that machines are taking over our lives, and that there will soon be an AI dictator.  

Well, people like to panic and you should be careful not to panic with them, but there is some truth to the fact that AI is radically transforming how we do our work, and there are dangers involved. If you've used ChatGPT, you know what I'm talking about: chatbots that can answer your questions and write code and essays for you. All this is thanks to machine learning: a set of algorithms that can learn from data.

The course will introduce you to the basic concepts of machine learning, and by the end of the course you will be able to apply these concepts, and with a little more research, come up with your own apocalyptic AI dictators.

But the course is not only about machine learning (that's why it has this long name). It's about how we're increasingly **understanding the world** using algorithms that learn models from data. 

And unlike a normal machine learning course, it will mainly focus on scientific modeling where we already have a lot of modeling techniques, and our standards for accuracy are pretty high.

Also, the course will expose you to the methods of building mathematical models in a various fields of science and engineering; that many of you are probably already familiar with. So you will see many of the things you already know (linear algebra, differential equations, numerical methods, algorithms etc.) in a new more applied context. 

The goal of the course is to put you in the mindset of a modern scientist/engineer who knows how to take advantage of modern modeling techniques (particularly machine learning) to solve a wide variety or problems. This is why, the course has much more weight on the project (40%) and the assignements (25%)

### Tell me more about you.

Before I tell you more about the course. Tell me a bit more about you. Names, and what's your background. Alright.

----

I like to think that the big question underlying the course is: How does the world work?

### How does the world work? 

Depending on where you come from, your training and your interests, you probably have different answers to this question. 
- A physicist might tell me about quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the standard model of particle physics.
- A biologist might tell me about the cell, the genome, and the brain.
- A computer scientist might tell me about algorithms, data structures, and complexity theory.
- A mathematician might tell me about the axioms of set theory, the Peano axioms, and the incompleteness theorems.
- A philosopher might tell me about the nature of reality, the mind-body problem, and the problem of induction.

But what do all these answers have in common?
They all develop and use **models**: representations, analogies, or abstractions of reality. 

Models are built out of words or numbers that we can manipulate, communicate.

We've essentially come up with all these models by observing the world and finding patterns in it; using something we call **intelligence**: a virtue we like to brag about a little too much. 

Historically, at first, we mainly relied on language to describe those patterns: like the sun comes out every day. But, not that long ago, we started using numbers to quantify those patterns. Then we started using equations to describe the relationships between those numbers. Finally, we started using computer algorithms to make predictions about those numbers.

We build representations of the world: using words, drawings, numbers, symbols, functions, equations, and algorithms etc. And we use those representations to *understand* (with some debate over what that means), and make predictions about how it behaves. 

This is why the course is called: data-driven *modeling* in science and engineering. The course will expose you to the methods of building mathematical models in various fields of science and engineering; that many of you are probably already familiar with. So you will see many of the things you already know (linear algebra, differential equations, numerical methods, algorithms etc.) in a new context. That is, if you know those things. If not, you will learn them in this course. 

But why data-driven?

### Quantifying the world 
You might have heard: "data is the new oil". The world is changing fast, and everyone is disoriented, afraid of losing their jobs (which they should be); as if the world will end. And the greatest culprit is who: artificial intelligence. The world has changed: 

- In how we learn about it: through the internet, online courses and videos, etc.
- In how we work: remote work, online meetings, emails, etc.
- In how we entertain ourselves: online games, streaming services, etc.
- In how we shop: online shopping, online payments, etc.
- In how we travel: online bookings, online check-ins, etc.
- In how we define ourselves in it and interact with it: on the internet and through social media,
- In how we build it: through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.
- In how we build ourselves: through genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and brain-computer interfaces.

All of these are possible thanks to our ability to map the real-world we live in (you and me, and these tables) unto words and numbers that we can manipulate, communicate and process using computers. So what's been happening in the three decades is essentially a revolution in the **quantification** of the world.

**Data is the world, quantified.** And quantification is the first step to building models. 

For example, this is what Galileo figured out 5 centuries ago. He was sitting in mass, bored to death, staring at the chandelier that was swinging above him, because the window was open and there was wind coming in. He started counting the number of oscillations of the chandeliers, simultaneously having his fingers on his wrist to count his heartbeat pulses. He noticed that the number of swings per pulse was the same regardless of its amplitude. He then went home and wrote down the first equation of motion for a pendulum. What he did then is find a way to 'count' the real-world, transform it into numbers, and then find a pattern, a mathematical analogy, that describes the relationship between those numbers. 

To understand the world, you have to first quantify it: turn it into data.

### A faster way to crunch numbers

In that respect, science has always been data-driven: we observe the world, we collect data, we build models, and we make predictions. But now we can we do all of that at a much larger scale, and much faster, thanks to computers. 

- The course bridges traditional scientific modeling with modern data-driven modeling techniques.
- Recent advances and examples in artificial intelligence, machine learning etc. -> What is AI? And how do those methods work?
- We're going to cover a variety of data-driven methods that are used in science and engineering. 
- In short, you will learn how to become a modern scientist/engineer who knows how to take advantage of modern modeling techniques to solve a wide variety or problems. 

### Scientific modeling
- Here's a model on intelligence (that I've come up with, so it's incomplete, and we're ascribing to Box's philosophy): from high-dimensional complex world, to data, to models and back.
- All models are wrong, but some are useful - George Box

- Mapping the physical world to the mathematical world to make predictions: Measurements, Data, Functions and Equations.
- A brief history of the scientific method: observation, hypothesis, experiment, theory.
- An example of an ampirical law: Darcy's law.

- A brief history of artificial intelligence: from logic to learning.
- The diversity of intelligences: there is no single intelligence.

- The three pillars of artificial intelligence: modeling, learning and inference: 
    - Modeling: finding mathematical analogies of the real world; functions, ODEâ€™s etc.
    - Inference: making predictions of unseen data: numerical solvers, search algorithms, etc.
    - Learning: optimizing over a set of models from data; language, image, video, time-series, etc.
    - The bowtie representation of intelligence.

### A few big questions we are trying to answer
- The big questions we face when we try to model the world: high-dimensional, nonlinear, multiscale, etc.
- The big questions about intelligence: what is human intelligence? What is artificial intelligence? What is the relationship between the two?
- Empirical laws: what is the relationship between the force and the length of the spring?

### Course summary and logistics

- The main purpose of this course is to get you into the mindset of a modern scientist/engineer who has to either use or create datasets, either use or create algorithms to deal with those datasets. The best way to get better at that (In My Humble Experience), is to:

- **Code, code, code:** become comfortable with programming and with learning libraries or languages that can help you solve your problem. Machine learning is a quickly evolving field, and no matter how much theory you know, you will need to keep up with new tools. For that I'll give you coding assignments, and I'll try to make them as fun as possible. They might be challenging, but I expect you to know how to use online resources to solve them when needed. This is part of being a computational scientist in this age.(see footnote).

- **Read and write:** the best way to continue learning after you finish this course is to keep up with the literature through reading, and to write about what you learn, and about your own project ideas. This is how you develop your creativity and your ability to communicate your ideas: these skills are always under-emphasized in STEM education, and you'll find that much of your job will turn into them. This is the purpose of the progress and final project reports.

- **Communicate:** the best way to learn is to teach. So I encourage you to discuss the course material with your colleagues, and to ask questions. There will be a short final presentation of your project. This is a good opportunity to practice your presentation skills, and to learn from your colleagues.

Students will be provided with a list of suggested datasets to which they have to apply concepts learned in the course. A progress report on the 9th week with completed milestones of the course is required. Graduate students are encouraged to apply machine learning tools to data collected from their own research projects.


**Online Resources Policy**
ChatGPT is not banned, but I recommend using it with extreme caution. I believe that you can only learn by actually THINKING about the problem, and this is the whole point of getting an education: we give you the opportunity to think about problems, and fail without consequences. This is how your mind becomes sharper and more creative. If you always use a solution manual or chatgpt (basically a smart but fallible solution manual), you basically learn to become obsolete. So everytime you use chatgpt, I want you to notice who is serving who.

So, my recommendation would be: read the question, try to solve it on your own as much as you can, write down your solution, ideas and questions; if you can't solve it, discuss it with friends, and then you can seek help from google or chatgpt. They are actually great tools for exploration; as both will give you great ideas and tips that will not be covered in class (we're only covering 1% of what's out there). I'm just giving you the foundations to start from somewhere.

### Project

The project will consit of a group project, where you will be asked to apply the concepts learned in the course to a dataset of your choice. You will be provided with a list of suggested datasets, but you can also use your own dataset. If you want to propose an idea, you should try to work on something where you're trying to answer a question for understanding a system. Unlike a typicaly machine learning course where you're only interested in increasing the accuracy of your model (often by trial and error), here you're trying to understand how the system works. So you should be able to explain your model, and what it means in the context of the system you're studying. We will talk a bit more about that next week.

### Assignment

- Find 10 applications of machine learning in science and engineering. And tell me which ones interested in pursuing.
